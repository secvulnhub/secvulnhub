**Current Challenge**: 100 Days of Cybersecurity Tool Development  
**Start Date**: June 10, 2025 - 12:45 EAT  
**Commitment**: 1 new utility every 5 days  
**Team Goal**: Build the most comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit for ethical hackers

Our core team (SecVulnHub group) follows this intensive development rhythm, focusing on tools that directly support bug bounty hunting and ethical hacking workflows. The repository welcomes quality contributions from the broader cybersecurity community at any time.

**Development Phases**:
- **Phase 1** (Days 1-20): Reconnaissance and Information Gathering Tools
- **Phase 2** (Days 21-40): Vulnerability Assessment and Web Application Testing
- **Phase 3** (Days 41-60): Exploitation and Post-Exploitation Utilities
- **Phase 4** (Days 61-80): Automation and Workflow Enhancement Tools
- **Phase 5** (Days 81-100): Advanced Forensics and Incident Response Tools

## 📋 Tool Categories

### Reconnaissance Tools
Information gathering utilities designed for comprehensive target enumeration, subdomain discovery, advanced port scanning, OSINT collection, and network mapping. These tools form the foundation of any ethical hacking engagement.

## 🤝 External Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the cybersecurity community. Here's how to structure your submission so our team can properly evaluate and integrate your tool into SecVulnHub.

### Tool Submission Structure

Every tool submission must follow this precise structure to be considered for inclusion in our repository.

**Root Directory Naming**: Use descriptive, hyphenated names that clearly indicate the tool's purpose. Examples include `advanced-subdomain-enumeration`, `api-security-scanner`, or `payload-encoding-toolkit`. Avoid generic names like `scanner`, `tool`, or `utility`.

**Required Files in Your Tool Directory**:

Your tool directory must contain these specific files for proper evaluation:

**README.md** - Your tool's comprehensive documentation must include these exact sections:

```markdown

```

**install.sh** - An automated installation script that handles all dependencies and setup procedures. This script must work reliably on fresh Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian systems, with proper error handling for common failure scenarios.

**test.sh** - A comprehensive validation script that demonstrates your tool's core functionality and edge cases. This helps our team quickly verify that your tool works as intended across different environments.

**src/** directory containing your actual tool code with meaningful comments explaining the logic, especially for complex security operations, cryptographic functions, or network protocols.

### What Makes a Tool Acceptable

Understanding our acceptance criteria will help you structure contributions that align with SecVulnHub's standards and mission.

**Practical Value for Ethical Hackers**: Your tool should solve a real problem that cybersecurity practitioners, bug bounty hunters, or security researchers encounter in their daily work. We prioritize tools that enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, or provide new capabilities in ethical hacking workflows.

**Code Quality and Security**: Your implementation should demonstrate solid programming practices with particular attention to security considerations. This includes proper input validation, secure handling of sensitive data, robust error handling, clear variable naming, and comprehensive comments explaining complex security logic.

**Documentation Excellence**: If our team cannot understand and use your tool within five minutes of reading your documentation, it will not be accepted. Your documentation should assume the reader is skilled in cybersecurity but unfamiliar with your specific tool's implementation and use cases.

**Testing Reliability**: Your tool should work consistently across different environments and handle edge cases gracefully. Include comprehensive test scripts and clear instructions for validating functionality in various scenarios.

**Ethical Use Focus**: All tools must have clear legitimate use cases in ethical hacking, authorized penetration testing, or defensive security operations. Tools that could easily be misused for malicious purposes must include strong documentation on responsible usage.

### Submission Process for External Contributors

Follow this step-by-step process for submitting your tool to SecVulnHub:

**Step 1: Research and Preparation** - Before starting development, research existing tools in our repository to ensure your contribution adds unique value. Fork our repository and create a new branch named after your tool using the format `feature/tool-name`.

**Step 2: Development and Documentation** - Develop your tool following our coding standards and security guidelines. Pay special attention to creating comprehensive documentation that explains both the technical implementation and practical applications in ethical hacking scenarios.

**Step 3: Package and Structure** - Follow the required directory structure exactly. Ensure your README.md, install.sh, and test.sh files are complete and thoroughly tested. Include sample configurations, wordlists, or test data if your tool requires them.

**Step 4: Comprehensive Testing** - Test your entire package on multiple clean systems representing different common environments used by bug bounty hunters and security researchers. Verify that your installation process handles dependencies correctly and your test script validates all core functionality.

**Step 5: Submit Pull Request** - Create a pull request with a descriptive title like "Add [tool-name] for [category] - [brief description]" and include a comprehensive description of what your tool does, why it's valuable for SecVulnHub, and how it fits into ethical hacking workflows.

**Step 6: Respond to Review Process** - Our team will conduct a thorough review including functionality testing, security analysis, and code quality assessment. Be prepared to iterate on feedback, answer questions about implementation choices, and make necessary improvements.

### Our Review and Testing Process

When you submit a tool, here's what happens during our evaluation process:

**Initial Screening**: We verify that your submission follows the required structure and includes all necessary documentation. Incomplete submissions are rejected immediately with specific feedback on missing components.

**Functionality and Security Testing**: We run your installation script on clean test environments representing different operating systems and configurations. We then execute comprehensive functionality tests and conduct security analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities or misuse scenarios.

**Code Quality Review**: Our team reviews your source code for adherence to security best practices, code quality standards, and potential integration issues. We pay particular attention to tools that handle sensitive data, perform network operations, or could impact system security.

**Practical Application Testing**: We evaluate your tool's practical value in real-world ethical hacking scenarios, testing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing alternatives.

**Integration and Compatibility Testing**: We verify that your tool integrates well with SecVulnHub's overall ecosystem and doesn't conflict with existing utilities or compromise repository security.

**Final Decision and Feedback**: Accepted tools are merged into the main repository with full acknowledgment of your contribution. Rejected tools receive detailed feedback explaining our decision and specific suggestions for improvement.
